# Deprecation notice

Since there are plenty of well maintained meteor packages which can do the same or even better, I suggest meteor developers to use https://atmospherejs.com/mizzao/bootstrap-3 instead.

# Bootstrap 3 for Meteor

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) v3.2.0.

It works for the latest Meteor [packaging system](http://docs.meteor.com/#usingpackages) introduced at 0.9.

## Installation

``` sh
$ meteor add pinglamb:bootstrap3
```
That's it. Enjoy.

## License

This package is licensed under the MIT license.
